## Introduction

Welcome to my first Redux app! This application demonstrates the basics of managing state using Redux. The app maintains a balance state, which is displayed in the navbar and can be updated through various components.

## Features

- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux for state management.
- **Balance Display:** The current balance is displayed in the navbar.
- **Balance Update:** Components can update the balance, and the changes are reflected throughout the app.

## Installation

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-redux-app.git
    cd first-redux-app
    

2. **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    

3. **Start the development server:**

    npm start
    

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can explore the app by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. The balance will be displayed in the navbar, and you can interact with various components to update the balance.
